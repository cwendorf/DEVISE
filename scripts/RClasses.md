this function sets a custom class to the returned object. but kind of object is it before the class()

estimateMeansSet.wsm <- estimateMeansSet.bsm <- function(moments, conf.level = .95, mu = 0, ...) {
  N <- moments[, "N"]
  M <- moments[, "M"]
  SD <- moments[, "SD"]
  Est <- M - mu
  df <- N - 1
  SE <- SD / sqrt(N)
  tcrit <- qt((1 - conf.level) / 2, df, lower.tail = FALSE)
  LL <- Est - tcrit * SE
  UL <- Est + tcrit * SE
  results <- cbind(Est, SE, df, LL, UL)

Before the line class(results) <- c("easi.frame", "intervals.main"), the object results is a matrix, specifically a numeric matrix created by cbind().

Here's how we can determine that:

Step-by-step breakdown:
cbind():

results <- cbind(Est, SE, df, LL, UL)
cbind() combines vectors column-wise into a matrix.

Since Est, SE, df, LL, and UL are all numeric vectors of the same length, results becomes a numeric matrix.

rownames(results) <- rownames(moments):

Adds row names to the matrix, still keeping it as a matrix.

comment(results) <- ...:

Adds an optional attribute comment, which is allowed on any R object, including matrices.

class(results) <- c("easi.frame", "intervals.main"):

This overrides the original "matrix" class.

Now results is an object of class c("easi.frame", "intervals.main").

Summary:
Before the line class(results) <- ..., the object results is a numeric matrix. After that line, it becomes a custom class object ("easi.frame", "intervals.main") with matrix structure.

You said:
even if it is unclass(), as a matrix, what would the print look like (given that there are optional attributes?
ChatGPT said:
Great question. Let's clarify how printing behaves when results is still a matrix — especially considering it has an optional attribute like comment().

🧠 Key Points:
A matrix in R is a 2D atomic vector with a dim attribute.

Adding a comment() attribute to a matrix does not change its structure or how it prints by default.

The comment() is not printed unless explicitly requested.

The matrix will print normally as a table of numbers with row and column names.

🧪 Example Simulation
Assume the matrix looks like this (e.g., 2 groups of means):

     Est   SE    df     LL    UL
A   2.50  0.25  19   2.00  3.00
B   1.80  0.30  24   1.20  2.40
And we add a comment:

comment(results) <- "Confidence Intervals for the Means"
Then print results (as a regular matrix):

print(results)
➤ Output will look like:
    Est   SE df   LL   UL
A  2.50 0.25 19 2.00 3.00
B  1.80 0.30 24 1.20 2.40
⚠️ The comment is NOT shown when you just print the matrix.

🔍 To see the comment:
You'd need to do:

comment(results)
# [1] "Confidence Intervals for the Means"
🧵 Summary
Even with the comment() attribute, printing a matrix behaves exactly as normal unless:

A custom print method is defined for its class (which you've added later with class(results) <- ...)

Or you explicitly call comment().

Once class is set, a custom print.easi.frame or print.intervals.main could show the comment — but as a pure matrix, it prints plainly.

You said:
what other optional attributes can be added to a matrix that is not printed?
ChatGPT said:
R lets you attach arbitrary attributes to almost any object — including matrices — without affecting their print behavior (unless a custom method is defined). These are called optional attributes, and by default, they are silently stored and not printed when the object is printed normally.

✅ Common Optional Attributes That Don't Show in print(matrix):
1. comment()
Stores a character string.

Example:

comment(mat) <- "This is a note"
2. Custom Attributes
You can add arbitrary attributes using attr() or attributes().

Example:

attr(mat, "source") <- "Simulated data"
attr(mat, "author") <- "Jane Doe"
3. label (used in some packages, like Hmisc)
Acts like a human-readable description.

Example:

attr(mat, "label") <- "Estimated group means"
4. notes / description / any arbitrary name
These are often used for storing metadata in statistical packages.

Example:

attr(mat, "notes") <- c("Derived from cleaned data", "CI = 95%")
5. timestamp, units, etc.
Used in scientific or time-series contexts.

Example:

attr(mat, "timestamp") <- Sys.time()
attr(mat, "units") <- "ms"
🔍 How to See Hidden Attributes
To view all attributes (including optional ones), use:

attributes(mat)
Or view a specific one:

attr(mat, "source")
⚠️ Attributes That Do Affect Printing
While most attributes are silently stored, some do affect printing if they are part of the object's class structure or used by a method:

class: Changes print behavior (e.g., makes it behave like a data frame).

dimnames: Already standard for matrices — used in printing row/col names.

names: If set on a matrix, it’s ignored unless coerced into a list.

🧵 Summary
A matrix in R can store optional attributes like comment, label, source, timestamp, or any custom metadata. These attributes:

Do not show up in print(mat)

Do not interfere with matrix operations

Are retrievable via attributes() or attr()

This makes them great for tagging objects with metadata without disrupting analysis or display.

You said:
which attribute is best for storing a title for the matrix?
ChatGPT said:
Great question! If you're looking to store a title or short descriptive label for a matrix — purely for human reference and without affecting computations — the best attribute choices are:

✅ Best Choices for a Matrix "Title"
1. label
Widely recognized in R conventions (especially in packages like Hmisc, haven, labelled).

Semantically clear: a "label" is often treated as a human-readable description or title.

Doesn't affect matrix behavior or printing (unless a method is defined to use it).

attr(my_matrix, "label") <- "Estimated Means for Each Group"
2. title
Very intuitive.

Not standard, but safe — R allows arbitrary attribute names.

Some custom packages might even look for title if they're metadata-aware.

attr(my_matrix, "title") <- "ANOVA Summary Table"
⚠️ Attributes to Avoid for Title-Like Info
comment: Meant more for notes than titles, and only allows a single string.

names, dimnames, class: These control structure/behavior, not meant for metadata like titles.

🔍 Recommendation
Use label if:

You're following R's broader ecosystem conventions.

You might later convert the matrix to a data frame or use it with metadata-aware tools.

Use title if:

You want something straightforward and semantic for your own functions or reports.

You can even use both — label for short text and comment for longer notes:

attr(my_matrix, "label") <- "Confidence Interval Summary"
comment(my_matrix) <- "Generated from standardized input; 95% confidence level"
🧵 Summary
🔹 Best attribute for a matrix title: label
🔹 Alternative (equally valid): title
🔹 Avoid using: structural attributes like names, class, or dimnames for this purpose.
